Congratulations! Now that we have completed the challenging "React and Servers Week", we are delighted to offer an opportunity for you to get additional practice and refine your skills in working with ReactJS via this additional practice repo. 



What is the Movie List Practice Repo? 

Movie List is a prompt for a front-end app you should build using React as the front-end framework.  The purpose is to give you an additional exercise in working with React so that you may:

Better understand your current comprehension level with React
Determine what areas you need additional training / learning with React concepts and functionality
Increase your comfort level with the front-end portion of a Full Stack Application
Movie List is not a test and not an assessment. It will not be reviewed by the staff to assess your performance (unless you book an office hour or we reach out to you!) and is solely intended for you to get more practice and identify areas of improvement for yourself.




How should I approach completing this repo?


1. Set up your dev environment first. You have a few options for this:
  a. Hard Mode: Learn webpack (hint: checkout the webpack docs and babel loader docs)
  b. Medium Mode: Set up files similarly to the recast.ly sprint (with a src and compiled folder), using babel to transpile
  c. Easy Mode: Use JS Fiddle or similar
Note: do not use generators like create-react-app or react-boilerplate, as you will not be able to use those throughout the program
2. Once you've set up your dev environment, work through each level to MVP (minimum viable product) before moving to the next level.

3. While you're working through each level, try to only use official documentation. Try not use Stack Overflow, your own notes, past sprint code, or any other external resources.This will help you develop familiarity with the docs as well as get you acclimated to a real test-like environment!
    a. See below for a list of suggested resources!
4. If you do need to reference past code/Stack Overflow, write down what topics you needed extra help on. Then, go find these topics in the official documentation.





Do I have to complete all of it? 

What is my time commitment for this repo?

  

This sprint is optional (unless we contact you and let you know otherwise). This repo should be only be worked on/completed outside of normal/daily sprint time. We trust that you will adequately divide up your time as to complete all of the assigned Sprint's Basic Requirements.  It can be a good exercise to time yourself to see how long you spend on different parts of the assignment.



While Movie List is an optional assignment, past students have said that Movie List has helped them immensely in preparing for the Technical Assessment. It's a great way to get more practice in implementing React! Additionally, you don't have to complete all of it at once. I would spread out working on the different levels over the next couple of weekends.





Can I work in a group?

NO. The intent for this repo is for you to individually assess what you know and don't know and also to practice without outside assistance. There will be additional opportunities on future practice repos for you to work with a partner.  If you must look back at Recast.ly for reminders, that is ok so long as you are NOT effectively just copy-pasting or copy-typing.  This is NOT learning!





What additional resources may I access when working on this repo?

We recommend only using the below-listed resources. This will really allow you to assess what you know. If you use additional resources heavily (i.e. Your old Sprint code) and are dependent on those additional resources then you will struggle on future assessments, technical interviews and other challenges where you are not allowed to use these additional resources. 

MDN
Official React website
Express docs
NodeJS docs
DO NOT use any boilerplate applications


How should I complete my work?

Create your own repo to do your work on Movie List. Be sure you've pushed all your work to GitHub!  





What should I do if I get stuck?

If you get stuck, time box trying to come up with the solution via trying code to 20 minutes and then use the websites to research and find the solution. 
After 20 minutes go onto the web and use the official sites listed above to help you get unstuck.
Feel free to immediately access the official websites for syntax! There is no need to memorize every detail of the syntax or function names.
If you are still stuck after doing all of this then for this repo you may go into your Sprint code and if that does not help then at that point feel free to perform a general Google search and StackOverflow search

I'm ready! Where do I get the prompt?

This is your third practice assignment and it is an excellent source of enrichment and enlightenment. We are super stoked and excited to work with you in increasing your technical prowess!!

Have a great week!
